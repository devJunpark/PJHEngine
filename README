This project was made by junpark.
I want to study about engine and using some library.

how to make a solution ?
 - First, You can find a make_sln.bat at script/build folder.
 - Second, Just run it.
 - Third, If it were successed, will open VisualStudio(maybe its version is 2013.).
          if It's not, please send email about error log. otherwise, please check the log and fix it.
 - Fourth, after opening the solution, you change a startup project to Prototype project.

 Thank you.
